# TODO

* [ ] Clearly divide View from Controller/Model -> Templates should not contain any logic except for rendering the page itself.
* [ ] Finish Account creation/login -> check identifier (email or pw?), does account already exist?
* [ ] Make use of namespaces
* [x] Reder/Display Markdown
* [ ] Upload (Design, Title, Description, etc...)
* [ ] Commenting
* [ ] List Blogs (Main Page)
* [ ] User Preferences (Change Username/Email/Password)
* [ ] Admin Page (Block or Delete User/Blog/Comment)
* [ ] Personal Blog Page (Basically same as Main-Page, but only Blogs of a specific user are shown) localhost/user/\<username\>
* [ ] Search from the navbar (Main- and Personal-Blog-Page) -> @user/blog-title/#tag
* [ ] Add tags to Blog Posts
* [ ] Make Pages more interactive -> JS/JQuery/React?
* [ ] Admin Account -> different view of website

## Create Account & Login

* [ ] Validation via HTML5! or JS?
* [ ] Dynamically (AJAX?/React??) check and validate user input
* [ ] Limit what characters can be used

## Login

* [ ] Allow user to login both, using either the email or the username

## Project

* [ ] Rapport/Doku
