# TODO

* [ ] Error handling -> The user should never see an error
* [ ] Clearly divide View from Controller/Model -> Templates should not contain any logic except for rendering the page itself.
* [x] Finish Account creation/login -> check identifier (email or pw?), does account already exist?
* [ ] Make use of namespaces
* [x] Render/Display Markdown
* [x] Upload (Design, Title, Description, etc...)
* [x] Commenting
* [x] List Blogs (Main Page)
* [ ] User Preferences (Change Username/Email/Password)
* [ ] Admin Page (Block or Delete User/Blog/Comment)
* [x] Personal Blog Page (Basically same as Main-Page, but only Blogs of a specific user are shown) localhost/user/\<username\>
* [ ] Search from the navbar (Main- and Personal-Blog-Page) -> @user/blog-title/#tag
* [ ] Add tags to Blog Posts
* [ ] Make Pages more interactive -> JS/JQuery/React?
* [ ] Admin Account -> different view of website

## Create Account & Login

* [x] Validation via HTML5! or JS?
* [x] Dynamically (AJAX?/React??) check and validate user input
* [ ] Limit what characters can be used

## Project
